## Register provider.

The provider must be registered as an `aceProvider`. We are only running CLI commands after all!

```js
const aceProviders = [
  "adonis-auth-scaffold/providers/AdonisAuthScaffoldProvider"
];
```



## Scaffolding your first app.

To scaffold authentication, run

```bash
adonis make:auth
```

## Getting help.

For help, run

```bash
adonis test --help
```
